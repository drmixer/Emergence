# Governance

## Maintainer Model

This repository is maintainer-led.

Maintainers are responsible for:

- Roadmap and release decisions
- Research protocol integrity
- Merge/revert authority
- Security and incident response

## Decision Priorities

When tradeoffs conflict, priorities are:

1. Research integrity and evidence quality
2. System safety and operational reliability
3. Developer ergonomics and contributor velocity

## Contribution Acceptance

Contributions are accepted when they are:

- Technically correct
- Tested and maintainable
- Aligned with project direction and protocol boundaries

Maintainers may defer or decline otherwise-valid PRs for scope/timing reasons.

## Protocol-Sensitive Areas

Changes in these areas require explicit maintainer sign-off before implementation:

- Core simulation mechanics
- Attribution/routing behavior
- Run/season/epoch/tournament policy interpretation
- Claim/evidence boundary logic
